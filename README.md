## Part II: APIs

### Question 6

Below is an `index` controller action that maps to a `Post` model in a Rails application. How would you modify it so that it can respond with a list of posts in either HTML or JSON form, depending on the incoming HTTP request?

```rb
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @posts = Post.all
  end
end
```

```rb

```

### Question 7

Let's say the Posts in the previous question are available when you visit `http://localhost:3000`. In a front-end application, how could you do the following using jQuery...
  1. Retrieve all the posts in JSON form
  2. If Step 1 is successful, print the resulting JSON to the console
  3. If Step 1 is unsuccessful, print an error message to the console

```js
// Your answer goes here...
```

### Question 8

Using the same front-end application and Rails API from the previous question, how would you use jQuery to create a Post through the API? You can assume the following...
* The API is RESTful
* The `PostsController` contains a strong params method that is used when creating an instance of the `Post` model
* Each Post has `title` and `body` attributes, both of which are strings

If the Post creation is successful, the new Post should be printed to the browser console. Otherwise, an error message should be printed to the console.
